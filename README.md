## Updates
0.2 [:](sankaku_Redirect_blocker.js) No longer shows the pop-up for a brief second


# chan Sankaku adblocker

Here I am making random scripts for https:// chan.sankakucomplex.com because I have nothing better to do. It mainly consists of a script to stop the stupid:
"You have been flagged as using Ad-block, or scripts that meddle with the Ad-block detection methods in place. To continue using the site regularly, disable them, or upgrade to Sankaku Plus! "

If you want to use the script, make sure to have TamperMonkey installed, create a new TamperMonkey script,  copy & paste my script, and save it.

so far, I have two scripts both updated to function without any bugs but if you do encounter anything please let me know
